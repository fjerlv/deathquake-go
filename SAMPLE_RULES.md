# Score and Sips Rules

- There exists **n** possible sips in one beer, where **n** is defined as: `max(player['frags'] for player in players)`
- The number of frags for a player when a round is over is **f**
- Everyone drinks **f** sip(s) of their beer, which equals **f/n** of one beer
- The winner is the player who first achieves a score of **16**. This will be the player who is both the best at playing Quake 3 and drinking beer

## Rules of Regulation

- If a player chooses to start playing a round without having consumed their sips, they are given one punishment-Limfjordsporter which must be consumed before the player can continue playing. This beer does **NOT** contribute to the total number of sips the player must consume
- If a player chooses to be sick, the player is disqualified and must leave the game
- It is the responsibility of the player to make it obvious to the judge how many beers they have consumed
- A whole bottle of beer consists of **14 sips**
- The judge is the person whose job it is to judge whether a player has conformed to the rules of regulation
